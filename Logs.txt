Problem Statement : 
While AES and DES are widely used symmetric encryption algorithms, their security fundamentally relies on the secrecy and randomness of the shared encryption keys. However, classical methods of key generation and distribution are vulnerable to interception, prediction, and cryptanalytic attacks—especially in the face of advancing quantum computing capabilities. This project proposes a hybrid cryptographic model that enhances AES and DES encryption by integrating quantum key generation and quantum key distribution protocols using Qiskit. Specifically, we simulate the BB84 protocol for secure key exchange between communicating parties and use a quantum random number generator (QRNG) to produce high-entropy encryption keys. The goal is to demonstrate that quantum-assisted key handling can significantly improve the confidentiality and unpredictability of AES and DES encryption without modifying their core architecture. By leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as no-cloning and measurement collapse, the project aims to fortify classical encryption systems against present and future threats, including quantum-enabled adversaries.

Plan : 
1) Phase 1 : Baseline step to create working AES and DES encryption functions using Python
2) Phase 2 : Simulate quantum key generation using Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)
3) Phase 3 : Simulate BB84 protocol between Alice and Bob for secure key agreement
4) Phase 4 : Replace classical random keys with quantum-generated/distributed keys
5) Phase 5 : Show the difference and benefit of quantum-generated keys

Project Activated : 

Phase 1 : 24-08-2025 13:13:04
    1) Building and verifying an AES and DES encryption, decryption algorithm to test the QKD later on. 
    2) Successful completion at 24-08-202 14:18:28

Phase 2 : 24-08-2025 14:21:24
    1) Creating a random 128 bit string. For this, we initialise a quantum circuit having 128 qubits and apply hadamard gate to each of them. Then, we measure them and each qubit falls to either 0 or 1 with a 50% probability creating a random string

Phase 3 : 24-08-2025 14:47:11
    1) In this phase, we try to create a safe channel between Alice and Bob to share their quantum generated keys using BB84 protocol. 
    2) Alice and Bob create their own random bases. Alice creates a random qubit string which she encodes using her bases and shares it to Bob. 
    3) Bob measures this encoded qubit string using his base. 
    4) Then these people share the bases over a common, authenticated channel. The bit place at which bases match are kept and the other are discarded. 
    5) If an interceptor is present, they will guess their own base but in the process randomise the things in the qubit. This interceptor can guess each bit correctly with a 50% probability and the bit at that position with 50% probability, so it can be correct 25% probability which becomes the threshold. 
    6) In an ideal scenario with no noise, even 1% error marks an intruder. But there can be noise interference so we keep it to 25%.
    7) One small problem, since we start with a big number of bits but discard when doing the basis match, we might not have enough quantum bits to perform the AES or decryption algorithm. So, we mitigate that in the next phase by calling BB84 as many times as required to get the least number of qubits.

Phase 4 : 24-08-2025 21:14:22

Showed this to Jaya Krishna sir. New suggestions : 
    1) Compare how this system will react to different key sizes
    2) Compare how well does this system encrypt and decrypt files of different sizes (10KB, 100KB, 1MB)
    3) Compare how better or worse this system is compared to existing classical cryptography. 

Phase 5 : 07-09-2025 15:13:07
    1) In this phase, we generate random payloads of 10KB, 100KB and 1MB. We also use generate keys of 128, 192 and 512 bytes for both classical and quantum key generation. Then, we compare the data. 
    2) Results found : 
        2.1) Speed : 
             AES encryption and decryption time is same since that itself is a classical step. Key generation makes any difference in the speeds of the system. For classical, speed is very fast, almost milliseconds. In quantum, key generation takes longer time, around 40 - 110 seconds

             So, classical wins here
        
        2.2) Security : 
             Classical technique is vulnerable to quantum attacks since they depend solely on mathematical assumptions and randomness. Quantum serves as a better alternate since it is based on laws of physics, provides eavesdrop protection and is resistant to quantum computer attacks. 

             So, quantum eats and leaves no crumbs

        2.3) Accuracy : 
             We are improvising key generation and distribution. Since we are not making any changes to the AES techniques in any case, both of them have same accuracy, reliability and integration. 

             So, there is no difference in these. 

        2.4) Scalability : 
             Classical is already very well adopted and used all across the globe. So, it is already scaled. For the quantum, due to the underdeveloped quantum hardware technology, the system is not scalable as of now. 

             So, classical is already steps ahead and working better.
